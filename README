Zynq mkbootimage

This is an open-source replacement for the Xilinx bootgen application.
It parses a .bif file and creates a Zynq boot image in .bin format.

It is written entirely in C.

Required C libraries: pcre, libelf.

Supports Linux and FreeBSD host platforms.

To build this application on Linux run:

 make

and on FreeBSD run:

 gmake CC=cc EXTRA_INCLUDES=/usr/local/include LDPATHS=-L/usr/local/lib

If you need a stand alone executable to move to different versions of your
operating system add to the make command line:

 LDFLAGS=-static

To use it, type in:
./mkbootimage [--zynqmp|-u] [--quiet|-q] <input_bif_file> <output_bin_file>

Zynq Support:
Currently it supports creating boot image containing fsbl, bitstream,
u-boot, and linux related binary files.

For loading linux related images, both the [load] and the [offset] attributes
are supported.
As opposed to the original bootgen, the file extensions are not required.

For example the following .bif file:

the_ROM_image:
{
  [bootloader]fsbl.elf
  fpga.bit
  u-boot.elf
  [load=0x2a00000]devicetree.dtb
  [load=0x2000000]uramdisk
  [load=0x3000000]uImage
}

Used as follows:
./mkbootimage boot.bif boot.bin

will generate a bin image which can be used in u-boot, as follows:
bootm 0x3000000 0x2000000 0x2a00000

Zynq Ultrascale+ support:
Currently it supports creating boot image containing fsbl, bitstream,
u-boot and the arm trusted software.
Linux related images are not yet supported.

For example the following .bif file:

the_ROM_image:
{
  [fsbl_config] a53_x64
  [bootloader] fsbl.elf
  [destination_device=pl] fpga.bit
  [, destination_cpu=a53-0, exception_level=el-2] bl31.elf
  [, destination_cpu=a53-0, exception_level=el-2] u-boot.elf
}

Used as follows:
./mkbootimage --zynqmp boot.bif boot.bin

will generate a bin image, which can be used to successfully boot a Zynq
Ultrascale+ machine.

Encryption certificates are not supported.
